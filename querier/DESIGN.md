# Design Spec

In this document, we provide a design specification for the Querier program, which takes user queries and searches for relevant documents based on an inverted index generated by the Indexer program.

## User Interface:
The `querier.c` program interacts with the user through stdin in the command line interface. The user is prompted to enter a search query, and the program provides search results from the crawler and indexer based on the query.

## Inputs and Outputs:

`Input`: User query entered through the command-line interface.

`Output`: A list of webpage search results containing their document IDs, urls, sorted by relevance.

### Major data structures
The `index` - 
the program uses an index data structure to efficiently store and retrieve information about a collection of documents. The index enables fast keyword-based searching by associating keywords with the documents in which they appear. This allows for quick retrieval of relevant documents based on user queries, without the need to scan every document. The program loads the index from a file specified by the user, and then utilizes it to process queries and search for relevant documents. 

The `counter` data structure is used to store term frequencies, which indicate the number of times a specific term appears in a document or a collection of documents. This can is useful for ranking search results based on their relevancy.
